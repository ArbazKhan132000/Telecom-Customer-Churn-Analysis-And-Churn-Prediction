# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Analysis-And-Churn-Prediction

This project is a comprehensive analysis and prediction of customer churn in the telecom industry. It combines data exploration, cleaning, ETL processes, and predictive modeling using various tools and technologies including SQL Server, Power BI, Excel, and Python.



### 1) Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze customer data to identify patterns and factors leading to churn, and to develop a predictive model to forecast future churn. The project is divided into several stages, each leveraging different tools and technologies to achieve the final outcome.
Data Exploration and Cleaning

### 2) Initial data exploration and cleaning were performed using SQL to understand the dataset and prepare it for further processing.
Data Cleaning: Checking for missing values, duplicates, errors.
Data Exploration: Explore data to understand the distribution.

### 3) ETL

The data was imported into SQL Server where it was extracted. The transformation and loading processes were then executed in Power BI.

- **Extraction:** Imported data into SQL Server.
- **Transformation and Loading:** Applied various transformations to standardize and enrich the data, and loaded the transformed data into Power BI for analysis.

### 4) Interactive Dashboard in Power BI

Using Power BI, an interactive dashboard was created to visualize key metrics and trends from the data.

- **KPIs:** Displayed important metrics such as total customers, new customers, churned customers, and churn rate.
- **ETL Process:** Created an Extraction, Transform, Load (ETL) process in the database and Power BI dashboard to visualize and analyze customer data across multiple         dimensions, studying churn profiles.
- **Calculated Columns and Measures:** Created calculated columns and measures for presenting important business KPIs.
- **Data Modeling:** Applied data modeling techniques for making connections between data sources and optimizing data relationships, reducing preparation time by 25%.

### 5) Churn Prediction with Python

Predictive modeling was performed using Python and its libraries.
    
- **Data Preparation:** Preprocessed data for modeling.
- **Model Development:** Built and evaluated machine learning model.
- **Churn Prediction:** Utilized machine learning algorithms to predict customer churn and optimize retention strategies.

### 6) Prediction Dashboard in Power BI

The predictions were loaded into Excel and then imported into Power BI to create a prediction dashboard.

- **Prediction Visualization:** Showcased predicted churn rates and identified high-risk customers.
- **Insights:** Provided actionable insights to reduce churn.

### Conclusion

The project successfully combined data analysis, ETL processes, predictive modeling, and data visualization to understand and predict customer churn in the telecom industry. The interactive dashboards and predictive models offer valuable insights for strategic decision-making.
